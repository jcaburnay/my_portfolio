                <p>I graduated at University of the Philippines - Baguio with a bachelor's degree of science in Physics. My thesis was focused on the ability of graphene-based material to convert heat into electrical energy. I have experience in MatLab and Arduino programming. I started self-studying web development programming to improve my skills in programming. In addition to becoming a well-known scientist I also want to become a software engineer/full stack developer.</p>
